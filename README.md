# Apple's Fork
**Note: **
This fork has been modified so that only items of type Gun, Melee or Throwable will have their icons exported. Used for a custom Killfeed plugin.

See Paradox's original code [here.](https://github.com/Paradox304/ParadoxUnboxingModule)
As well as his ParadoxUnboxing plugin [over on ImperialPlugins](https://imperialplugins.com/Unturned/Products/ParadoxUnboxing) that it was made for.

# ParadoxUnboxingModule
**How to use:**
1. Download the latest release from here https://github.com/Paradox304/ParadoxUnboxingModule/releases/tag/1.0
2. Extract this file and put the folder "ParadoxUnboxingModule" in Modules folder of your Unturned directory (**NOT SERVER**).
3. Subscribe to any mods you have on your server and need to get the icons from.
4. Load up Unturned **WITHOUT BATTLEYE**
5. Go in Singleplayer and join any map, it will lag a bit and when lag is over go to Unturned/Modules/ParadoxUnboxingModule/Icons and you'll have all the icons named with the id of the item. To search for any specific item icon, just press ctrl + f and type the item's ID in.
